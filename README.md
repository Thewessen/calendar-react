# Calendar

## Introduction

This app is created as an assessment for a potential job. It contains a fictive calendar
component. The time limit of the app is four hours. The app doesn't have to be
done after the four hours are over.

Because I really wanted to showcase all different aspects of creating an app
(logic, state, styling, cleaning etc.) I pushed as hard as I could to
finish the app.

## Steps

- Model the recuirements.
- Create basic logic for this fictive calendar
- Implement the logic in the components
- Cleanup

## After

Oke.. I did finish.. but just barely. I didn't test all capabilities of the
app. And I believe their is still a bug in my calculation on the game logic.
Also the styling could be done much better.

Atleast I've created something to talk about.
